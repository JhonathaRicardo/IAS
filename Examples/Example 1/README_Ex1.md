# Example 1 - Analysis of Gas Target

To demonstrate the software we will display one of the data obtained in the experiments carried out in the High Power Laser Laboratory at IPEN.
The gas jet in this example was generated by a homemade supersonic nozzle [[17]](#reference) fixed inside a vacuum chamber. During data collection, the nozzle backpressure was maintained at $~50$ $bar$ with nitrogen gas. The interferograms were generated by the second harmonic (395 nm) of ultrashort pulses from a Ti:sapphire multipass CPA system [[1]](#reference) and obtained using a Mach-Zehnder-like interferometer, as discussed in [[16]](#reference).
## How to use
Detailed usage of the software will be described below:
### 1. Open Files
The user must open a Target interferogram file and a Reference interferogram file, using [***Open File***] and [***Open Ref.***] buttons, respectively.
In this directory (*Interferogram Data*), the users can find two interferogram files to download. A Reference *Interferogram_reference.png* (in *Fig. 1. a*) and a Target *Interferogram_gas.png* in (*Fig. 1. b*). This image files are be used in this example.

### 2. Select Area
The User must select the area of ​​the image for IAS analysis, using the [***mouse click***] or [***X Coord***] and [***Y Coord***]



All input parameters used for gas-jet characterization are shown in *Fig. 10*.
