## Example1 - Analysis of Gas Target
In the Example folder of this repository, the user will find two interferogram images shown in Fig. 9. These images were obtained using a Mach-Zehnder-like interferometer, as discussed in [16].

|*Fig. 9. Examples of Interferogram images: reference image (on the left), and laser-induced plasma image (on the right).*|

The plasma was generated in the atmosphere (~80%) and the interferograms were generated by the second harmonic (395 nm) from ultrashort pulses of a Ti:sapphire multipass CPA system [1]. To characterize the registered plasma the user must select the area around the plasma.
All input parameters used for plasma characterization are shown in Fig. 10.
