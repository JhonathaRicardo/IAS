## Example1 - Analysis of Gas Target
To demonstrate the software we will display one of the data obtained in the experiments carried out in the High Power Laser Laboratory at IPEN.
The gas jet in this example was generated by a homemade supersonic nozzle [[17]](#reference) fixed inside a vacuum chamber. During data collection, the nozzle backpressure was maintained at $~50$ $bar$ with nitrogen gas. The interferograms were generated by the second harmonic (395 nm) of ultrashort pulses from a Ti:sapphire multipass CPA system [[1]](#reference). 
The user will find the two interferogram images shown in *Fig. 9*. These images were obtained using a Mach-Zehnder-like interferometer, as discussed in [[16]](#reference).
