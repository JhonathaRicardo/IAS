The gas jet in this example was generated by a homemade supersonic nozzle [[17]](#reference) fixed inside a vacuum chamber. During data collection, the nozzle backpressure was maintained at $~50$ $bar$ with nitrogen gas. The interferograms were generated by the second harmonic (395 nm) of ultrashort pulses from a Ti:sapphire multipass CPA system [[1]](#reference). 
The user will find the two interferogram images shown in *Fig. 9*. These images were obtained using a Mach-Zehnder-like interferometer, as discussed in [[16]](#reference).

All input parameters used for gas-jet characterization are shown in *Fig. 10*.
