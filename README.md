# IAS
Interferometry Analysis Software (IAS) is a dedicated tool for studying gas, vapor, and plasma jets. IAS uses a new algorithm and GUI to analyze interferograms. It can retrieve the accumulated phase shift and apply Abel inversion to estimate the density profile of targets (gas, vapor, or plasma).
